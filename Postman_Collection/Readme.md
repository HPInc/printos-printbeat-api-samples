## About the Postman collection
- A Pre-request Script inside the collection uses the CryptoJS library to dynamically generate the authentication HMAC.
- This Pre-request Script may also set some necessary environment variables which are used in the HTTP Headers section for each call.
- The response field can be used to capture response JSON messages from the Jobs API calls.

**NOTE:** Some of the API calls may be dependant on certain environment variables being set to valid values in your environment.  Make sure they are defined correctly if errors occur.
